            <h3>The Aegean Economy</h3>

            <p>The Aegean economy reflects that of real life. 
            We have chosen to leave it up to players to decide based on <span style="font-weight: bold">supply and demand</span>.
            Trading may occur anywhere along the vast world of The Aegean, but players dedicated to the art of 
            marchantilism may want to head over to dedicated markets where they'll find the bulk of buyers looking 
            for rare items or simple supplies.</p>

            <h3>Our Progression System</h3>

            <p>Experience is mostly obtained by performing tasks related to a specific skill, 
            but also questing, random events, minigames, or achievements. 
            After gaining a certain amount of experience, players will advance to the next level in that skill, 
            which unlocks new abilities and areas around the world.</p>
            <p>Every players starts at level 1 in every skill except for Hitpoints at 10. 
            Every skill can reach the maximum level of 100, a massive achievement. You will find that the first levels
            are quickly obtained, but as you progress, it becomes exponentially more difficult and delayed. 
            Only the most dedicated players will ever max a skill. They will be rewarded.</p>
